# TO Be Named intgrated Co-Learning process Algorithm
Algorithm or framework for all stages on the road to achivement 
  
_"Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man"_  
_Sir Francis Bacon_  
  
  Reading = coursework  
  Conference = Laissez-passer.org - crypto art festival  
  Writing = Pneuma token Whitepaper
