### Ridiculous Example:
#### autonomous robotic classroom
1. robotic driving classroom write one page research paper setup repository/webpage + CV webpage 
1. learn Ardino and hardware skills 
1. meetup and/or present at Houston Robotics Club find and integrate new team members
1. whitepaper/business plan or resume
1. crowdfund implement release
