# Achievement Algorithm &  intgrated Co-Learning process.
Algorithm or framework for all stages on the road to achievement  
  
_"Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man"_  
_Sir Francis Bacon_  
  
  why pay money when you can make money organizing gatherings  
Reading = coursework  | your own code solutions
Conference = Meetups and Conferences | Laissez-passer.org - crypto art festival  
Writing = crypto Blogging | our own Pneuma token Whitepaper  
  
## An interchangable Roadmap
_No matter who, we all could use similar templates and guides from whatever idea to final achievement_  
Resume and/or resreach website (make templates)  
Read or Learn (example solidity course, Pluralsight)  
Corresponding Conferences,Meetups and groups (list meetups, entrepreneur environment)  
writing based on what you have learned and/or reaseached (whitepaper & business plan)  
Crowdfunding, Implementation etc.

### Ridiculous Example:
#### autonomous robotic classroom
1. robotic driving classroom write one page research paper setup repository/webpage + CV webpage 
1. learn Ardino and hardware skills 
1. meetup and/or present at Houston Robotics Club find and integrate new team members
1. whitepaper/business plan or resume
1. crowdfund implement release 
  
  
## Dedication
  each collaborator can dedicate his contribution:  
  
 * Charles Finney - _"To my Father James Daniel Finney who taught me how to read, before I entered Kindergarten, so I would stop chewing up books, and shared his sense of awe and wonder about the universe, by demonstrating background radiation of the Big Bang with television static."_
    
* Anatoly Bourov- 
      
* Troosey -  
    
 * John - 
     
 * others
